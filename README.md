Problem Statement
The COVID-19 dataset contains multiple columns with missing data and inconsistencies that could hinder meaningful analysis. Columns with excessive missing values reduce the reliability of insights derived from the data. Additionally, without proper handling of missing or incomplete data, trends such as case growth, death rates, and other critical metrics cannot be accurately assessed. To ensure effective decision-making, the dataset must be cleaned and prepared for further analysis.
Recommendations
Drop Columns with Excessive Missing Values:
Remove columns where more than 50% of the values are missing, as they provide limited value for analysis.
Handle Remaining Missing Data:
Use appropriate imputation techniques to fill missing values for critical numeric columns (e.g., mean, median, or mode for numerical data).
For categorical columns, consider filling with the mode or creating a separate "unknown" category.
Data Quality Checks:
Ensure data integrity by removing duplicate rows and verifying column data types.
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify anomalies or outliers.
Visualization:
Use data visualization tools to identify patterns in missing data and understand trends in positive cases and deaths over time.
Documentation:
Document all cleaning steps, including the rationale behind column removal or value imputation, to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
Conclusion
The cleaning of the COVID-19 dataset is a critical step to enable meaningful analysis and accurate reporting. By removing columns with excessive missing values and imputing missing data in essential fields, the dataset becomes more reliable for trend analysis and decision-making. Following the recommended steps ensures that the data is consistent, accurate, and suitable for answering critical public health questions related to the pandemic's progression.
